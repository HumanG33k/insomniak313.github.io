Isometric city builder HTML5 + JS.
Uses require.js

At this day :
  - Map generator done, need to be improved
  - Splitting of game and gui done (2 canvas)
  - Mouse event (mainly map manipulation)

Note that index.php can be easily converted into HTML, I only use inclusion of <?php echo date(); ?> in src of script and stylesheets in order to bypass my browsers caches.
